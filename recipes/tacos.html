    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortillas</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Details:</h3>
    <p>Simple.  Delicious.  <em>Amazing.</em>  No need to waste your time with other inferior taco recipes.  This recipie will leave your guests <strong>drooling</strong> and </strong>BEGGING</strong> for more TACOS!</p>
    <p>Just open flour <em>OR</em> corn tortillas and start stuffing!  It's just that simple... and TASTY!</p>
    <p>Add some vegetables, whatever floats your boat.  <em>Important: The key to remember here is that you put good stuff in the tacos!</em>  The tacos need cheese too.  <strong>MORE</strong> cheese is certainly the appropriate amount of cheese to be using for these tacos.</p>
    <p>Sauce on top... or in the middle... OR on bottom.  <em>HOT</em> sauce is recommended, but the sauce does not NEED to be <em>HOT</em> if you are unable and/or unwilling for whatever reason to handle the <strong>HEAT!</strong></p>
    <p>Summer got ya' sizzlin'?  <em>DON'T</em> heat-up the kitchen with your oven -- no need with these simple, gorgeous, spectacular tacos.  They're so good as is, but you can cook them if you want to.  Go ahead, figure it out.</p>
