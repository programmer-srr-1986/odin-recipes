    <h1><strong>Pizza</strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Details:</h3>
    <p>This is the other recipie on this site.  This one is <em>not</em> worse than the others though.</p>
    <p>It's <em>easy</em>.  Get some dough, preferably pre-made so you don't have to do as much work.  You'll definitely want to put stuff on top of the dough before it goes in the oven.  I know: more work.  Maybe you should just order a pre-cooked pizza instead.</p>
    <p>But you <em>didn't</em> order a precooked pizza instead.  So now you're here.  Congratulations!</p>
    <p>Once you put all the stuff listed in the ingredients section in whatever amounts you wanted to, (or not,) <em>I'm not judging you,</em> maybe someone else is, but NOT me; you'll probably want to bake it.  If you have a brick-oven, that would probably be nice.  If you have one of those, you'll probably know what time/temperature to aim for when you cook the pizza.</p>
    <p>If you <em>don't</em> have a brick-oven, a regular oven works too.  I heard that 350 degrees farenheit for twenty minutes-or-so will probably be okay to at least start melting the cheese.  GOOD LUCK!!</p>
