# odin-recipes

This is the README file description for my first webdev project integrating the lessons/tools I have read-over/practiced with up until this point.

Following this project's completion, I should demonstrate my capability to work with (Git, GitHub, HTML:) foundational usage and integration.

POST-PROJECT:
I was able to utilize this project as a great practice space for testing myself with HTML basics.  I made a few notes to myself for future practice sessions:
e.g.:
1) Will need to integrate FONT/FORMATTING skills at a later point.
2) Will need to read/learn/implement LINK-SECURITY VS SEO considerations as appropriate following increased knowledge acquisition.
3) Will need to be more mindful/attentive to legal/copyright issues, (e.g.: appropriate use/citation of photos, etc.) 
Git/Github:
I definitely need more practice so as to understand when it is ideal to STAGE VS COMMIT.  I didn't do nearly enough of either for this project - and it really shows in my commit messages.  SO many changes with no detail as to what/why things were changed with so little saving/uploading to the VCS in between developemnt stages.
I need to get better at streamlining ATOMIC COMMITS with clear, concise documentation in the commmit messages.
